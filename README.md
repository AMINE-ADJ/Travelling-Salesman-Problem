# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
This repository contains a JavaScript implementation for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. Our solution is based on an Exact Method : Branch and Bound, and a Heuristic method : Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
